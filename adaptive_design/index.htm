If you see this unusual behaviour of double for the first time, then after short introduction into double mechanics you can understand this code. More important, you can simple solve many other prekols with doubles. Amazing! So, main features of simple prekols
<ul>
    <li>Easy to understand</li>
    <li>Easy to explain</li>
    <li>Easy to solve similar prekols</li>
